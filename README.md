# Face-Detection-with-webcam
In this Project, we will see how to develop real-time human face detection in Python using OpenCV. The objective of the program given is to detect objects of interest(faces) in real-time and to keep track of the same object. 
Face Recognition is a part of computer vision where we locate and visualize faces using ML models in any digital image. 
OpenCV contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc. 
Face detection using Haar cascades files is a machine-learning approach where the model is trained with a set of input data.
